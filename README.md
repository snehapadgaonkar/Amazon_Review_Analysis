## Goal
The primary objective of this project is to build, train, test, and deploy an Artificial Intelligence (AI) model capable of predicting sentiment from real Amazon Echo customer reviews.

## Toolset
- **Jupyter**: For managing project dependencies and environments.
- **Python**: The programming language used for data processing, model building, and deployment.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For machine learning model building and evaluation.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Seaborn**: For enhanced statistical data visualization.

## Practical Real-World Application
- AI and ML-based sentiment analysis is crucial for companies aiming to gauge customer satisfaction automatically.
- It eliminates the need for manual review of thousands of customer reviews, thereby saving time and resources while providing valuable insights into customer sentiment.

## Data
### Inputs
- **Amazon Reviews**: Text data from Amazon Echo customer reviews.

### Output
- **Sentiment**: Binary sentiment classification (0 for negative sentiment, 1 for positive sentiment).

### Usage
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Run the preprocessing script to clean and prepare the data.

2. **Model Training**:
   - Train the model using the training script.

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the model's performance.

### Results
The performance of the model will be evaluated based on various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
